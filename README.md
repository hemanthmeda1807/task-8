### Network Speed Comparison
Used Internet Speed Test
without VPN:

With VPN:

fast but not good as without VPN

*VPN slightly reduced speed, but remained usable.*

## VPN Encryption and Privacy Features
## What is VPN Encryption?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts internet traffic between your device and the VPN server, protecting data from:
- Hackers
- Government surveillance
- Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
- Public Wi-Fi threats

---

## Encryption Algorithms Used

VPNs employ robust encryption standards for both control and data channels:

| Channel         | Purpose                     | Algorithms Used                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Data Channel    | Encrypts transmitted data   | **AES-256-GCM**, AES-128, ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Control Channel | Secures key exchange & auth | **TLS 1.3**, RSA-4096, ECDHE                 |

- **AES-256-GCM**: Military-grade encryption used by most modern VPNs.
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Lightweight and faster for mobile devices.
- **TLS 1.3**: Ensures secure handshake and session management.

## VPN Protocols

Protocols define the rules for secure data transmission:

| Protocol    | Features                                        | Common Use                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| OpenVPN     | Open-source, strong encryption, customizable    | Desktop clients (most secure)     |
| IKEv2/IPSec | Fast reconnect, mobile-friendly                 | Mobile devices                    |
| WireGuard   | Lightweight, high-speed, modern encryption      | Next-gen VPN services             |
| L2TP/IPSec  | Legacy support                                  | Outdated                          |
| PPTP        | Weak encryption, insecure                       | ‚ùå Avoid                          |

## Key Privacy Features

### Kill Switch
Automatically blocks internet access if VPN disconnects, preventing real IP exposure.

### DNS & IP Leak Protection
VPNs route DNS queries through encrypted tunnels, preventing DNS leaks. we can verify by accessing the links below:
- https://dnsleaktest.com
- https://ipleak.net

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
Each session uses unique encryption keys. Even if one key is compromised, past sessions remain secure.

### No-Logs Policy
Trusted VPNs like ProtonVPN do not store:
- Browsing history
- Connection timestamps
- IP addresses

### Tor Over VPN 
Some providers allow routing VPN traffic through the **Tor** network for maximum anonymity.

|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| AES/TLS Encryption      | Protects data from interception                 |
| Kill Switch             | Prevents data leaks on disconnect               |
| No-Logs Policy          | Ensures privacy by not storing user activity    |
| Leak Protection         | Prevents DNS, IP, and WebRTC leaks              |
| Secure Protocols        | Uses trusted VPN protocols like OpenVPN         |
| PFS                     | Protects past sessions even if key is leaked    |
